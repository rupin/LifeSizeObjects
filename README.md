This Python script allows you to split an image in JPG format that is too large to print on a single A4 sheet into a grid of smaller images that can be printed on multiple A4 sheets and assembled.

## Requirements

* Python 3.x
* Pillow library

## Usage

1. Install the required libraries: `pip install -r requirements.txt`
2. Run the script: `python generator.py path/to/input_image.jpg`
3. The output images will be saved in the same directory as the input image.

## Example

Here's an example of how to use the script:

```python
python generator.py input_image.jpg

Make sure to replace `Image Grid Generator` with the name of your project and fill in the details as necessary. 

Also, make sure to include a `requirements.txt` file that lists the required libraries and a `LICENSE` file that specifies the license for your code.


This will split the input image into a grid of smaller images that can be printed on multiple A4 sheets.
